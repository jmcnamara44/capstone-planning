## Description

_This project will build plan the layout for my capstone project.  Planned capstone project is a website/app that takes 2 locations and finds a spot somewhere in the middle for them to meet. Middle points can be filtered and sorted by type of activity that is in between. This project will build a static model of the site and will identify where state will live. Once the capstone project idea is finalized, this section will be updated._

## Project Specs

_User should be able to enter 2 locations they are searching for and have the api locate them._
_Once locations are entered, a location halfway should be generated._
_The meeting location should give directions to reach it for each starting location._
_Attractions close to the meeting location should be given._
_Users can filter and sort the attractions based on their interests._

_Users can change the type of transportation they will be taking to the meeting point._
